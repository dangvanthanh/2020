Dear friends.

How are you? Last month, I have visited Binh Ba island with my company. I'll tell you all about an exciting company trip. We got into the car quite late, approximately 11:00 PM. 

We arrived at the port of Binh Ba in the early morning. Getting away from the crowded city, the air is really fresh. Then we go to Binh Ba island by canoe. In the canoe, the feeling of surfing on the waves is great. 

On the island, we continue to travel around by boat. The boat goes slower than the canoe, but the boat engine sound is so quiet, we can talk and kid together. The boat stop in the middle of the sea.  Everyone begins swimming, another person diving to coral and sea fish. We have the chance to go on the banana boat. About 10 persons on the banana boat and surfing on the waves in the middle of the sea is thrilling and funny.

In the afternoon, we go to the beach and go play team-building games. We play finding shoes, unlocked, and who the longest game. Especially, I like the longest game. All people join in a long way. The game brings people together. 

Lastly, the evening was full of fun with us. We go to dinner on the raft. We are sing, dance, drink beer, and wine. It's crazy, even someone rolls back and forth on the floor. Everyone in my company cracked up. It's relaxed and funny.
