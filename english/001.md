# Talking about my favorite holidays.

On holidays, I like to go hiking, getting away from it all. Nothing relaxes me as much as wilderness. I and my friends working the different cities. Hiking is a place where I and my friends can be meeting. Sometimes, we are meeting new friends on the road mountain. Talking with strangers about the same hiking hobbies is really interesting.

When to go hiking, I am surrounded by nature. Birds chirping, tree leaves blowing in the wild, the sound of the stream flowing. It's refreshing to escape from the usual city life.

When I go to the top of a mountain. There is a feeling of freedom. The view you see is amazing and beautiful.

Besides hiking, typically in the longest holidays. I come back to my hometown, stay at home with my family. There is a precious time for me to spend together with my family. Talking my life away from home, my parent's daily work, funny stories after my young brother married... It's very warmful.
